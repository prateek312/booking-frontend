# Frontend - Java/React Technical Test

This is the frontend component of the Java/React technical test. It provides a user interface for creating, managing, and retrieving bookings for a property management system.

# Technologies Used

    React (ES6 or newer)
    npm or Yarn (package managers)

# Setup Instructions

To run the frontend application locally, follow these steps:

    Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from https://nodejs.org.

    Clone the repository or download the source code.

    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

    Install the project dependencies by running either of the following commands:

        If you use npm:
npm install

If you use Yarn:
    yarn install

Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server with the following command:

    If you use npm:
npm start

If you use Yarn:
        yarn start

    The frontend server will start running and automatically open in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.

# Usage

The frontend provides a user interface for performing the following operations:

    1. Create a booking
    2. Read one or more bookings
    3. Update a booking
    4. Delete a booking

Interact with the user interface to perform these operations and see the changes reflected in the backend.
